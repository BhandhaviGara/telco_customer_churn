Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn in a telecom company using classification algorithms and data analysis


# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to leave the company (churn) using Machine Learning models.

---

## Project Objective
Customer churn is a major problem in the telecom industry. The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and build a predictive model that helps identify customers at risk of leaving, so businesses can take preventive action.

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted categorical data into numerical format  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Analyzed churn distribution  
   - Visualized important features affecting churn  

3. Feature Engineering  
   - Created useful features  
   - Removed weak or irrelevant columns  

4. Model Building  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  

5. Model Evaluation  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report
